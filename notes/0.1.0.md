### First public release

This library was created because using the Scalatra Auth libraries felt too much like hard work for me, and after doing my hard work I thought I'd share it!

To start with it provides simple username and password log in assuming that your code already has some object representing uses and can validate their password.

It provides simple method like:

    redirectIfUserAuthenticated()

    redirectIfUserNotAuthenticated()

    onlyIfUserAuthenticated {
        // Your code goes here.
        // This is intended for ajax responses which should fail and not redirect if the user is not authenticated.
    }

    userLogout()

to handle user access control in your `ScalatraServlet` code.

The first two can take a path String to specify where to redirect to.

The currently logged in user is made available throught the `userOption` variable.

Documentation on how to set it up is available at the GitHub repository: [scalatra-userauth](https://github.com/sroebuck/scalatra-userauth).
