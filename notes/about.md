[scalatra-userauth](https://github.com/sroebuck/scalatra-userauth) is a simple user authentication library for Scalatra designed for getting authentication up and running without having to do too much work.  This library currently only has a bog standard username and password authentication scheme but it would be really easy to add others and I probably will if someone else doesn't get there first.

It is licensed with a do anything with it MIT license.
